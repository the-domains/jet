This was another vivid dream and I had remembered it pretty clearly. I typed it up so not to forget it. If you read about my other dream I told posted about that repeated, it may or may not have anything to do with it.</p><p>I was dreaming I was in this room, it was relatively a big office room. I believe it was 2 others and myself. I do not know why we were down there but for some reason we felt as if we could not leave the room. There were people outside and we felt as if we were being kept against our will. I believe one was a woman and one was a man in addition to myself. We were concerned and were talking about ways to escape. It seems as if this isn’t the first time and that last time we had help. The room has a few things in them and the ceiling was those lightweight white squares that can be taken down. We were talking about how we could climb up there to get out. We talked a moment about pros and cons, about how someone who helped us disappeared and if we should do it now or wait a bit. I mentioned that we cannot just walk around as the thin metal does not support our weight. The woman made a joke, “So you’re saying I’m fat?” We had decided to go ahead and try, I was going to go first since I had experience doing it before.</p><p>Before we started people started pouring in someone we knew came in and they were in military uniform and we started talking to him. Other people I did not know or talk to were coming into the room. There was still the sense of no one able to leave but the feelings of panic started to rise. After awhile of a little tense, we knew someone was going on. There was a lot of noise outside the door and upstairs. I finally said, “No one said we couldn’t leave did they?” The others shrugged, not thinking they were told either. The noise upstairs had subsided so I decided to try and casually walk out.</p><p>I got to the door and when I opened it there were people coming in, blocking my way. I was determined to leave but I did not want to make a scene so I was going to let them come in and I exit behind them. It looked as if I was opening the door for them to left them in. They stopped at the door, they were military, one was a commander who began to speak. He was nervous, definitely shaken. He started to explain what was going on. He was saying something about we’ve made a mistake, I knew he meant the military or government, and he said that were was a fire up above. People and I were confused. I was not sure if there was an actual fire or if he was trying to use different words. I knew we were below ground level and thought maybe there was a fire upstairs. People were getting anxious and loud. He said, “There a nuke…” people went out of control, crying, angry and scared. I finally spoke up, loud enough to be heard over the crowd, “What do we do?” I said. The commander was thinking, stuttering, I could tell he was thinking as a military commander, as someone apart of the group responsible, I interrupted his thoughts, “No! What do we (I pointed, motioning to the crowd) do right now?!”</p><p>I woke up.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">Dream: A Fire In The Sky</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
