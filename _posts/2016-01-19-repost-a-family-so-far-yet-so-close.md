I recently lost my father and mother, my 2 nephews and niece.

They were brutally murdered for no real reason. The pain in my heart seems unbearable.

Their last name was Fogel.

Tragedies befall people all over the world. Some seem so far off that they do not even enter our mind for contemplation. Should I feel this pain so acutely? Why do I still cry for them? They were a family of Jews in Itamar, very far away from life. Yet when I think of their loss I feel as if it was my actual father and mother. I think of my 2 nephews and niece, whom I have not seen in awhile, and think that they were murdered.

**A family so far, yet so close.**

I feel a deeper connection with the people of Israel. With each day, the more I connect with the community at the synogogue I attend I also feel a connection with the people. I have been sensitive to the world around me for some time. Until recently I did not realize how heightened it was in regards to fellow Jews across the world.

I realize I am not Jewish, however at this point the only acceptable option remaining for myself is to choose to become Jewish.

I do not make this decision lightly. I know enough about history to understand its pattern. Time is cyclical. What has happened before can easily happen again. I know that in my choice I not only accept the beauty and awe that is within Judaism, but I accept the risk and pain that can follow. In my mind, to choose Judaism one also accepts the chance that the world could once again turn its back on the Jewish people. We are in a world with people so selfish that they riot against a government that can no longer give them free handouts. A people in other areas stirred up in war mongering. Financial hardships sweep many countries across the globe. Natural disasters wreck havoc. Is humanity strong enough and smart enough to not allow the types of inhumane treatment of people to happen again? This evaluation of humans sounds bleak; however these are things going on today. What if the world decides they need a scapegoat? Time flows like a river. Will history repeat?

Even still, I wish to become Jewish.

I wish to be a part of a people who constantly remind themselves to go and change the world for good. I believe that Judaism is the right choice for me religiously, however the reason goes beyond that as well. I feel my mission is to change the world. I believe in my abilities to have a positive impact. As I am following the destiny before me it has led me to where I am and who I've become. Perhaps tomorrow destiny will choose to be harsh, however if it is among the Jewish people, I shall not falter. I will continue to work for a better world, for a better tomorrow.

Until that age comes...

Tikkun olam.
