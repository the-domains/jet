The more I see and learn the more I realize that I must take responsibility for this world. Through my perceived inability to act, I have allowed negativity to fill the world. I say "perceived" because we all have the ability to act. In the past, I have convinced myself that I do not make a difference in the world. That I am just one person or one voice and have little to no affect. I was wrong and I take full responsibility for it.

A small stone cast into the water causes a ripple and these can turn into tides of change. By my inaction I have allowed an empty space for negative actions to fill. In my void, others have taken it upon themselves to affect the world in a very negative way. Edmund Burke once said, "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." For this, I am deeply troubled and filled with sorrow. Though I cannot change the past, I will change tomorrow.

It is a long road to have a positive impact in the world, I realize that one cannot make an external change without first addressing the internal. If a person does not change themselves and go to make a change in the world then they can easily become swayed by the darkness that exists in the world. Those who hate and destroy will have your ear if you cannot distinguish them from those who want to heal and repair. "Be the change you want to see in the world," are famous words by Mahatma Gandhi. I have been trying to echo these in my own life. It is not a line to be crossed but a path to follow, one I hope to maintain my whole life.

Still, I am responsible. How many times did the world call out for help and I did nothing? How many people could I have helped with just my pebbles? I should have acted then and by doing so I could have helped save a village, prevented a war, and allowed a leader of peace to survive starvation. â€Ž Piotr Cywinski said in regard people's response to the Holocaust Memorial that "Empathy is noble, but it's not enough." The same is true for all tragedies in the world. We can feel pain and sorrow for others, however if we do not act upon that then we are worth less than those who feel nothing and yet still give and act in a positive way.

Maybe the tears of the past missed opportunities will always flow from my heart, however I cannot allow those tears to blind me from the days ahead. I will endeavor to make a change in this world. This is my world and one that I am accountable for. If I do not act then someone else will in my place. They can choose to fill the world with negative change. A change I do not want and not want for my children. I would be allowing a negative change that can ripple through time and cause countless to suffer. If that happens, it is my fault for my inaction. It will be my lack of doing something to make a positive change in the world. This is no longer acceptable.

I am responsible for my community, my state, my nation, my continent, the entire world. I do not get a pass because something is happening in another country. Just because it is with a group whom I disagree with does not make it acceptable for them to suffer. This is a heavy burden, but one I must take. I am prepared to sholder this alone, however it will make it all the more difficult to manage. I am in hopes that my friends and family will also walk with me on this journey of bearing this burden. I will pray to God for help that others will come to help carry the weight. I will never pray for God to remove the responsibility because then I would be asking to remove the world. This is my world, God gave it to me, and I am responsible for it. Maybe someone will come to help, until then, I will take responsibility and be active in this world. I will change the world.
