The choice to move was both easy and difficult. Here I was, in Austin where I had lived for almost ten years, and had eked out a reasonably comfortable life. I was attending an amazing acting class at [In The Moment Studios with Laurel Vouvray][0], had a great job with [Interfaith Action of Central Texas][1] as their Communications Coordinator, was working on film projects here and there and had a great network of friends that I really cared about and who cared about me.

**But, something was missing.**

I'm sure most could say that there was something missing in their lives. It what makes us strive for something more. Life goals and passions it what helps us get up and struggle with life. And, yet, I knew Austin was not my home. I grew to love it (though it took some time to fall in love with it) and the people there. So when I felt I had enough training with Laurel (which was about 4 years at this point) I decided to make the move. I had visited both Los Angeles and New York and felt that NYC was a better fit for me. L.A. just didn't impress me. I didn't jive with the vibe there. But New York felt great. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/682b956a-6ed7-4e58-9d83-a66717165366.jpg)

So, I made a plan and starting winding down my requirements in Austin. Started saying my goodbyes and lessening the things I owned. I only kept a car load which I would take back with me to leave at my parents. It was a challenge and sometimes it felt like I was doing something wrong (like selling my SNES, that nostalgia is strong...), but in the end I knew it was time for me to move forward. I felt some kind of calling I guess you could say.

Or maybe I just needed a change...

Regardless of the reasons, **moving to NYC was both the best and worst choice I could have made.** Think over my time here, I am completely thankful for it as I wind down my time in NYC and readying myself for the move to San Francisco.
