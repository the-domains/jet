My name is Jason Erick Taylor, though my friends or cool people tend to call me Jet. I am an actor who started out in Austin, TX, moved to New York and about to move to San Francisco.  New York has been an experience to say the least. It has taught me many things. 2015 has been a trial of fire and ice. 

I'll go into more on my recent experiences at a later date. I feel I've learned much through trial and **error**. 

I am excited about the move and feel it is the right step for me. I will continue to pursue acting in SanFran and keep the momentum moving forward.

This website is on the platform of [The Grid][0]. As stated on their website:

> The first artificial intelligence (AI) platform that creates websites.

I became a founding member a long time ago and I am now finally able to use it. I used SquareSpace for the time being and though it served my needs it was really only a stepping stone to be getting on The Grid. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3dfbaa38-b819-4d40-ba5b-99082ddc1ad1.png)

I will most likely continue the communications, web & graphic design work as a side gig. I enjoy many elements of it even though it isn't my main squeeze, acting. Posh Cat was originally the name I was to use for my production company for my film projects I was planning to do in Austin but things have a way of changing so I put that on the shelf. 

But who knows what San Francisco has in store for me. 

I'll end this post with one of my favorite (I have many) quotes:

> [You gotta do it. You gotta.][1]
