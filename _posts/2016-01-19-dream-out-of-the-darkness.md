Dreams are an interesting thing. I think they are important and can show things we either do not see or do not see yet. I think I have told only a hand full of people my dream. I had this dream several times when I was young with sometimes with several years in-between each instance. It was always the same, more or less. It is so visceral that I am uneasy about telling others. I feel the ambiguity of my identity makes it easier to tell things more personal to me.

I am walking down a dark corridor trying to find a way out. I am not sure if it is a hallway or subway, it feels underground. There is a light in the distance. Then someone asks me a question. I am not sure what it is but I seem to confidently answer them. I turn to see a child (not sure if the child appeared in each dream). I turn to look behind me and there is a small group of people following me. I don't know why and not sure if I know them or not. The people are not a threat. I continue until we reach the source of the light. Stairs lead up to an opening, I can see the sky. I turn to look back and no one wants to go forward, I do. I tell everyone to wait and I'll be back. I head up the stairs and when I reach the top, I am come out in a building that was in ruins. I scan the horizon and there is destruction everywhere. I usually wake up at this point.

The intense feeling is that I am looking for or concerned about someone. I wanted to be selfish and run off, leaving the group of people behind but I didn't. In some instances of the dream the person is with me, in others they are not. When they are with me, I turn to go back down the stairs and they are coming up to me. I wake up before I realize what they look like.
